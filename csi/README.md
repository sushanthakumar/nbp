## Introduction

This project is the [OpenSDS Project](https://opensds.io/) NorthBound Plugin for
[Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec).

Container Storage Interface (CSI) aims to define an industry standard
that enables storage vendors (SP) to develop a plugin once and have
it work across a number of container orchestration (CO) systems. The
container orchestration (CO) systems include Kubernetes, Mesos, Docker,
Cloud Foundry and so forth.

This project will implement all the interfaces defined by
Container Storage Interface (CSI). It has seperate plugins for supporting block and file storages.
